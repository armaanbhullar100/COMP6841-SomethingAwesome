This the the list of keyboard commands this program accepts and what they do:

- "test" : It will minimise all windows, open notepad and enter 'You've been hacked!'
- "pause" : It will block all inputs from the user for 10 seconds
- "url" : Sends the url to a specific url.
- "rotate" : Rotates the screen 90 degrees
- "remap" : Remaps all of the alphabet keys to something different
- "screenshot" : Takes a screenshot and displays it to the user
- "minimise" : Keeps all applications minimised for 10 seconds

There also exists another command, a doomsday button which deletes key files on the driver and cripples the operating system.
