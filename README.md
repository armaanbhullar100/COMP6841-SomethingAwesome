## What is it?
This is a program that listens to the users keyboard and waits until it sees a command it recognises and then runs the corresponding functionality.
The commands it runs are listed below but before it checks for those, it also runs an autocorrect function on any of eligible words.

This the the list of keyboard commands this program accepts and what they do:

- "test" : It will minimise all windows, open notepad and enter 'You've been hacked!'
- "pause" : It will block all inputs from the user for 10 seconds
- "url" : Sends the url to a specific url.
- "rotate" : Rotates the screen 90 degrees
- "remap" : Remaps all of the alphabet keys to something different
- "screenshot" : Takes a screenshot and displays it to the user
- "minimise" : Keeps all applications minimised for 10 seconds

There also exists another command, a doomsday button which deletes key files on the driver and cripples the operating system.
